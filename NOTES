When building from source, "python setup.py install" requires the following non-Python packages:

Ubuntu packages:
- apt-get install nodejs
- apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev

Ruby Gems: (the Ubuntu ruby-compass package is quite old)
- gem install compass

Note that on Ubuntu 12.04, the following is needed first to pick up a newer npm ...
  apt-add-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
  apt-get update

I found this useful when being really paranoid about doing a clean build:
(assuming using a virtualenv in ~/venv ..)
  rm -rf build dist mormuvid/client/dist ~/venv/bin/mormuvid \
    ~/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mormuvid-0.0.1-py2.7.egg \
    ~/venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mormuvid-0.0.1-py2.7.egg
