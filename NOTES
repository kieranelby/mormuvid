When building from source, "python setup.py install" requires the following non-Python packages:

Ubuntu packages:
- apt-get install nodejs
- apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev

Ruby Gems: (the Ubuntu ruby-compass package is quite old)
- gem install compass

Note that on Ubuntu 12.04, the following is needed:
  apt-add-repository ppa chris-lea/node.js
